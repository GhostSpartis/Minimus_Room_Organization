# My Personal Project - Minimus
## Room Organization Done Right

The **main objective** of this application is to help the user 
**organize their room through the philosophical lens of Minimalism** the application will allow you
to inventory a list of items and their description of their value to you as well as their value in CAD into a room.

*Possible features include:*
- Categorizing items within a room
- displaying icons for each category
- Having multiple Rooms
- Include photo of the item once clicked on
- list of removed items
- Statistics on which item category is most likely to be removed and kept
- Ranking of the items based on a ten point system + in-depth description of value once clicked on
- marking items for sale 
- adding up marked items to see possible final value in CAD
- Graphical *My Room* box representation to place item within (based on given square foot)

## Who is this For ?
This is meant to cater to people who want to change and **clean up their messy room in a more organized and
systematic manor** in a way that will not only **improve their environment** but **will also help paint a clearer picture 
of the type of things that are important and hold value within their lives**

## Why am I interested in this topic
Recently Ive gotten really into the psychology and self-help books, this has taught me that one of the most
important things when it comes to growing as a person and achieving what you want is having a clear picture and a clear mind.
This led me down the path of philosophy through the book , the daily stoic, as well as digging into the values of stoicism 
and later on minimalism. Long story short, a person's environment is quintessential when it comes to clearing one's mind
, as having cluttered room is the same as cluttering your brain. So since my room is pretty cluttered with a lot of stuff 
right now I thought it may help me and other people who want to clear up space and grow achieve this goal in a more palatable
way.
